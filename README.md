# vst3sdk-nix

Here's an attempt to package the VST3 SDK for Nix/NixOS. Meant for dev env flakes. All it's doing is cloning the repo and storing it lol

## Usage

idk lol but i'm pretty sure it can be used. Include it in your flake and then go figure lmao (if you manage to get it working pls make a pull request with instructions!)
